# ------------------  EDIT THE CORRECT FILE  -------------------------
#
# This file is copied to /etc/cron.d/tuleap from
# /usr/share/tuleap/src/utils/cron.d/codendi when the tuleap service is started via its
# init.d script and the file /etc/cron.d/tuleap is removed when the
# service is stopped.  Therefore any edits made directly to
# /etc/cron.d/tuleap will be lost anytime the tuleap service
# restarts.
#
# To make changes edit the master copy /usr/share/tuleap/src/utils/cron.d/tuleap and then
# restart the service to pick up the changes (/sbin/service tuleap restart).
#
# The reason this is done this way is because the tuleap cron jobs
# should only be invoked if the tuleap service is enabled and not
# just as a consequence of installing the rpm as was the case
# previously. The file /etc/cron.d/tuleap cannot simply be linked to
# the master copy in /usr/share/tuleap/src/utils/cron.d/codendi because for security reasons cron
# will not process crontab files that are links or writeable by
# anybody else but root, thus the file must be copied into /etc/cron.d
# with the right ownership and permissions.

#
# The launch of the tasks is randomized to avoid high load on servers running multiple Tuleap instances
# Tasks expected to be launched at specific moment are started within a half four (1799 seconds) of the expected time
#

# The delay should be managed as an env variable so command line and process name will be the same if the command is
# run with delay (cron) or without (CLI). This way the concurrent process check will work
