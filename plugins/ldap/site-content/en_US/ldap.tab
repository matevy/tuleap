plugin_ldap	ldap_sync_reminder_mail_notification_body	Dear $5 project administrators,<br/><br/>The user $1 <$2> will be automatically removed from your $5 project <em><a href="$3">($4)</a></em> tomorrow. His status will change from Suspended to Deleted .<br/>Please consider cleaning up your project <em><a href="$3">($4)</a></em> by changing data referencing this user (artifacts assignment, user groups, etc.).</br>After the automatic removal, it might be more complex to find artifacts where the user was involved, so cleaning up before the removal is recommended.</br>The account itself will not be deleted therefore $1 can remain as assignee or owner of legacy artifacts in all services (documents, tracker, Files, Subversion, Git, etc).</br></br>This account cannot be further referenced by new artifacts or re-assigned to already existing ones.
